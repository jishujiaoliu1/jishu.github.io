How should programmers improve their programming skills?
==
Let's first talk about the qualities and abilities that an excellent programmer should have. Only in this way can we have goals. Otherwise, it will be like a car driving in random directions. Although you may have enough purpose, you will never reach the end point.
The status of an excellent programmer
1. Have a very clear understanding of computer systems (CPU, MEM, OS, DISK/IO, Network). This understanding will affect his understanding of computer load, network load, program and DB load of cognition. That is, he can clearly know how to balance each part of a system.
2. Have a clear understanding of algorithms and be able to balance the investment in people and hardware very rationally. He has his own very strong advantage, the so-called pyramid structure of knowledge.
3. Have a relatively independent understanding of technology and be able to know the development direction of yourself and the industry. He will not constantly chase C to C++, C++ to Java, Java to Scala. On the contrary, he will know very clearly what is mainstream and what he needs.
4. Keep learning. If an excellent programmer gives up learning, it will be the beginning of his departure from the technical world.
